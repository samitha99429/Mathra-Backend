<h3 align="left"> Mathra - Child Vaccination Mobile Application</h3>

<h2 align="left">Description about the project</h2>

As 3rd year 1st semaster User Experiaance Engineering module we have to develop a mobile application.So that we come up with a software solution for our project.

<p>In 2015, the globe began working toward a new global development agenda, with the goal of achieving the targets outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. (SDGs). With all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least 12 deaths per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least 25 deaths per 1,000 live births, the proposed SDG target for child mortality aims to prevent the preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five by 2030. Out of the 195 nations examined, 125 had already achieved the SDG target for under-five mortality, and 16 more were projected to do so by 2030 if present trends hold. The probability of dying between birth and exactly 5 years of age, is expressed per 1000 live births.
 So, we discovered that the reason for the under 5 years of mortality increasing is because children missed some vaccines which should vaccinated their age such as polio. Because some parents don’t have much knowledge about their children’s vaccination process.
After analysed we come up with the solution which is an application that helps to conducting the vaccination process of the children.
